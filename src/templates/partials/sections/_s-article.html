      <h2>1998. Began the history (H2)</h2>
      <p>The brand’s name came symbolically — as the <strong>memory of Company’s foundation day</strong> –  the 21st of November. On that date by the customs of <em>Ukrainian Orthodox Church</em> we celebrate St. Michael’s day.  Mario is Italian version of  Michael and the family manufactories — are the foundation of the Italian production. There is no accidental association with Italy —  the first heated towel rail products have been invented in ancient Rome, and were presented as a flat container for drying clothes, heated by fire. Later, in Europe towel wormers were gratings beside the fireplace of rich gentlemen’s houses. The masters liked to use warm towels  after the bath procedures.</p>
